TO DO:

Main menu

Main menu should create Level01, the score, the timer, the badIP list

When the level ends the level object should be destroyed,and the next one created after a pause

If creating the new level object does not reset the IP list then I've made a function to do it

Reset the timer as well, but not the score!

The boxes need to make the text in front of it, each box holds its own IP address and the other info

The text needs to scroll too, my translate script won't work anymore it has too much stuff to do with boxes in it. But the code in the update function should be the same minus the score stuff

The raycasting for clicking needs to be done

What happens when you click needs to be done (pop-ups, destroying box and its text)

End level screens need to be shown with score

End of game leaderboard

Then back around to the main menu (reset game)
